        At Trinity University, we create connections. We are a private, liberal arts and sciences institution in San Antonio, Texas, where our 2,430 students discover, grow, and become visionaries to make the world a better place. Our Pathways curriculum blends the liberal arts and sciences with business and pre-professional programs, enriching our writing, speaking, and problem-solving skills. We confront global challenges and challenge the status quo. We are confident. We are curious. We are catalysts. And we are Tigers.

    <p> 
        Duke TIP’s 7th Grade Talent Search helps academically talented students identify their strengths, develop their abilities and interests, and celebrate their achievements at a crucial time when they are forming their identities and looking ahead to the future. Participants learn about their strengths with an above-level test (either the ACT or SAT) and receive benefits like specialized publications and resources, educational guidance, recognition of their abilities, and academic challenges. Enrolling in the 7th Grade Talent Search is also the first step to attending TIP’s renowned online and face-to-face educational programs.
